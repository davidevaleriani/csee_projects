<p>Your goal is to find the expected value of winning a poker hand given certain pocket cards (i.e. "hand") and a certain amount of players in the table.
    Data is self-explanatory, but in a more intuitive way:</p>

<p>n_players &#8594; Total number of players (ranges from 2 to 10)<br>
pocket_0 &#8594; The first card you hold<br>
pocket_1 &#8594; The second card you hold<br>
board_0 &#8594; The first board card (part of the flop)<br>
board_1 &#8594; The second board card (part of the flop)<br>
board_2 &#8594; The third board card (part of the flop)<br>
board_3 &#8594; The fourth board card (part of the turn)<br>
board_4 &#8594; The fifth board card (part of the river)</p>

<p>Cards have the following interpretation:</p>
